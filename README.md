***THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL FORK OF THE ORIGINAL [JavaMP4BoxGui](https://sourceforge.net/projects/javamp4boxgui/)***  
Currently it is just my **personal playgroud** and I am not ready to give any guaranties regarding 
maintainance, stabaility or anything else! If you are looking for anything stable, please look somewhere else!

Description of the original project:

# JavaMP4BoxGui
A Java GUI for MP4Box

This is a simple GUI for the application MP4Box! It can join MP4 (h264) and automatically create chapters for each video.

Just drag&drop the videos from your filebrowser to the JavaMP4BoxGui application, and the videos will appear in the list!

The source code is included in the Jar file atm!

Tested on:
- Windows 7 and XP
- Ubuntu 13.04 based distros
- Mac OSX 10.8

Should work on any that support Java, MP4Box and HandBrake! The OS commands can be tweaked in settings.conf file.

PS! I've seen a lot of torrent hit's when you google my apps name. Consider all of them fake and dangerous to download!
